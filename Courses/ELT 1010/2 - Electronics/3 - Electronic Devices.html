<h1>Electronic Devices</h1>
<hr />
<p>With the various kinds of electrical components, there are devices that can be created. These devices are useful when making anything electronic.</p>
<h2>Processors</h2>
<p>Processors are the base of computers. The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the most important part of a computer. Processors are also used in all kinds of portable devices.</p>
<p>A processor is defined by its ability to perform an action given to it.</p>
<h2>Micro-controllers</h2>
<p>Micro-controllers are similar to processors, but are defined by their inability to perform actions given to it. They are mostly important for embedded systems. Many processors use micro-controllers to perform functions that they cannot.</p>
<h2>Common Devices</h2>
<p>Along with processors and micro-controllers, many computer parts are very common. Motherboards are used in all computers, screens are used in almost every modern device and keyboards/mouses are just as popular.</p>
<p>It's important to realise how useful the simple electronic concepts are in the real world. Understanding how these work is critical to understanding the bigger ideas of modern technology.</p>
