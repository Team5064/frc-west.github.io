<h1>Electrical Components</h1>
<hr />
<p>Inside of a circuit, there are plenty of different kinds of components to use. This range of things includes simple components like switches to complex devices like microprocessors.</p>
<h2>Electrical Parameters</h2>
<p>To use a device in a circuit, you need to understand how electricity is characterised and measured.</p>
<h3>Voltage</h3>
<p>Voltage is the electrical potential difference. It is the difference in charge that creates a circuit. Zero volts would indicate a dead circuit. Voltage is measured in volts, which are equal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule">joules</a> per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb">coulomb</a>. Multimeters are usually used to measure voltage.</p>
<h3>Current and Resistance</h3>
<p>Current is the flow of electric charge. It flows when there is voltage present across any conductor. The way to measure current is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere">ampheres</a>, which is basically the "flow rate".</p>
<p>Resistance is any change in the current's voltage. Semi-conductive materials all apply a certain amount of resistance to circuits, as well as resistors.</p>
<p>According to Ohm's law, resistance is equal to V / I.</p>

<h3>Capacitance</h3>
<p>Capacitance is the ability of a body to store electrical charge. The most common appearance of capacitance is in capacitors.</p>
<h2>Circuit Adjustment</h2>
<p>There are components that adjust the electrical parameters of a circuit. Remember that these effect circuits differently depending on the type of circuit (series / parallel).</p>
<h3>Resistor</h3>
<p>Resistors come in many different shapes, sizes and functions. To tell what the resistance of a resistor is, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code#Resistor_color-coding">here</a>. Resistor work using very specific semi-conductive materials that are manufactured for their purpose specifically. There are such things as variable resistors, such as potentiometers. These are less accurate and reliable than normal resistors.</p>

<h2>Sensors</h2>
<p>In a lot of electronics, you need to find out things about the external world. This could be for a lot of reasons, like other sensor calibration. It could even be for computerised functions like an accelerometer in a cell phone for flipping the screen.</p>
<h3>Rotary Encoder</h3>
<p>Encoders are useful for measuring speed and position of a rotating shaft. They are useful because they allow unlimited rotation, and are good at measuring data quickly. Typically, encoders are measured using 1 to 16 different sensors that measure on or off on a certain position of the shaft. The on or off signal comes from things like magnetic signal, visual signal or physical bumps.</p>
<h3>Accelerometer</h3>
<p>Accelerometers measure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force">G-force</a>. They use specialised technology that allows them to be used in many different kinds of applications.</p>
<h3>Switch</h3>
<p>The most simple electric sensor is the switch. Even though they are very simple, they are still useful.</p>
<h3>Optical Sensors</h3>
<p>There are sensors that use visual queues as signals. Some of these sensors are simple cameras, and some are designed for certain applications. There are sensors that return whether there is a certain colour in front of them. Others can tell the distance from the object in front of them. There are a variety of optical sensors.</p>
<h2>Actuators</h2>
<p>Along with sensors, it can be useful to perform actions in the physical world. Actuators do things to make physical objects move.</p>
<h3>Motor Controller</h3>
<p>Before sending a current to a motor, it can be useful to specify what speed the motor should run at. Motor controllers allow a signal to control the speed. This can be an adjustment in voltage, or quick successive changes from on to off.</p>
<h3>Relays</h3>
<p>Relays are electrically operated switches. They allow the electricity to move from left to right or right to left.</p>
<h2>Power Supplies</h2>
<p>Power (voltage) can be supplied by a variety of different methods. Much of our locally supplied electricity is given in AC. This makes certain procedures necessary in components.</p>
<h3>AC-DC Conversion</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-DC_conversion">Rectifiers</a> are used to convert electricity from alternating current to direct current. There are many different kinds of rectifiers. Some produce a constant voltage, and some simpler devices simply unify the signal, making it very inconstant. (half-wave or full wave)</p>
<h3>Current Protection</h3>
<p>There are many risks to electronic devices from over-current. There isn't any de facto way to do current protection. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(electrical)">Fuses</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker">circuit breakers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_sensor">temperature sensors</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_limiter">current limiters</a> are all commonly used mechanisms.</p>
