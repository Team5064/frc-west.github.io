<h1>Safe Work Practices</h1>
<hr />
<p>It is to everyone's benefit for you to be safe. You remain happy and healthy, and there is lower risk for damages. You should always be safe when working, no matter the situation.</p>
<h2>Working</h2>
<p>There are serious risks when working. Depending on the work being done, these risks can include anything from minor injuries to death. These risks must be taken seriously.</p>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<p>The basic rules to work safely with equipment are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be trained with the equipment you are using</li>
<li>Be familiar with the safety precautions for the equipment</li>
<li>Always be safer than you think you should</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically,</p>
<ol>
<li>When working with saws, never bring hands near the blade</li>
<li>When working with heat, always wear protective gloves</li>
<li>When working with anything pressurised, relieve pressure when it becomes too high for the container</li>
</ol>
<h3>Apparel</h3>
<p>In a workplace, it is a good idea to always wear safety glasses. For more information on safety glasses, see <a href="http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/prevention/ppe/glasses.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>It can also be a good idea to wear steel-toed boots in machine shops.</p>
<h3>Awareness</h3>
<p>As much as safe equipment and apparel will help keep you safe, the best way to stay safe is being safe yourself. Being acutely aware of your surrounding is invaluable. A work space is not the place to fool around or have fun with friends in. These are serious risks to your safety, and the possibilities far outweigh the fun of fooling around.</p>
<h2>Near Work</h2>
<p>Even though you might not be working, being near work exposes you to the same risks as a worker. Be sure the people working are aware of your presence, and that you are required to be there. If you do not need to be in the workplace, you should <em>not</em> be there. There is no reason to risk injury by being there.</p>
