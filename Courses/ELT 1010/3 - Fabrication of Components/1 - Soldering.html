<h1>Soldering</h1>
<hr />
<p>Soldering is a process used in electronics to join two or more metals together with a <em>solder</em>. Solders are metals that have lower metal points than the joining metals.</p>
<p>Most of the time, soldering is used to connect wires together, or attach <a href="http://store.curiousinventor.com/media/images/how_to_solder/joint_examples_good_DIP.jpg?1248414213">joints to PCB boards</a>.</p>
<p>The main tools used in soldering are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering_iron">soldering iron</a> and  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solder">solder</a>.</p>

<h2>Flux</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(metallurgy)">Flux</a> is used in soldering to make solder joints clean. It prevents the metal from oxidising, since the metal is at such high temperatures. Some fluxes not only prevent oxidisation, but also provide some chemical cleaning. It's important to know what kind of flux you are using, to know what to expect.</p>
<p><em>Fluxes are almost always included inside of solder</em>. Remember to look at your solder to see if you need separate flux.</p>
<h3>Water-soluble</h3>
<p>Water soluble fluxes allow the solder to be washed with water after the process to remove the flux.</p>
<h3>No-clean</h3>
<p>Fluxes that are no-clean do not <em>require</em> cleaning afterwards. That is to say that their residues are not dangerous to the solder.</p>
<h3>Rosin</h3>
<p>Traditional rosin fluxes leave a <strong>corrosive</strong> residue, and <em>must be cleaned</em>. RMA flux does not require cleaning (is not significantly corrosive), but it is still recommended.</p>
<h2>PCB Soldering</h2>
<p>Most commercial PCB soldering is done through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflow_soldering">reflow</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_soldering">wave</a>. If you're curious, example videos are available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu0v8lfLcKg">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntxIdJTygIE">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Problems with Soldering</h2>
<p>There are thousands of ways that your solders may end up with problems. Oftentimes these problems happen over time and can't be immediately seen.</p>
<p>The most common problem with electronic soldering is a <em>cold solder</em> joint. This is usually because the solder is melted directly, instead of being melted onto the part itself.</p>
<p>Another common problem is a <em>dry joint</em>. This usually occurs when the soldering iron is removed, and the joint is moved. There isn't enough heat to keep the joint together and the connection ends up broken.</p>
<p>Any flux that is corrosive that isn't cleaned off after soldering can cause problems to a solder. Be sure to clean solders whenever needed.</p>
<p><strong>Good joints look good</strong>. It should be pretty intuitive to tell if a solder is good. Good joints should be silver, shiny, concave and slightly bubble-like.</p>
