<h1>Compilers</h1>
<hr />
<p>You might not be familiar with how a text file can become something that a computer can execute. This process is completed using something called a <em>compiler</em>. Compilers are used in different ways, and different programming languages use different techniques. Sometimes, even, the same language has multiple ways of being created.</p>
<h2>Programming Language</h2>
<p>To understand what a compiler is, you need to understand what a <em>programming language</em> is. Just like linguistic languages, there is no one "official framework" for what a programming language is. Generally, programming languages are sets of formats, syntax and concepts that combine into a usable framework for executing computer programs.</p>
<p>Usually (almost always), programmers write programs in simple text files. From there, the programmer uses a compiler or interpreter. The key difference between a compiler and interpreter is that a compiler <em>creates</em> the program, and an interpreter <em>runs</em> the program. These things happen to differing degrees.</p>
<h2>Compiler</h2>
<p>Compilers create executable files. There are differing ways to do this, but they all accomplish that same basic goal. Some create files that an operating system can run, and some create files that run on a <em>virtual machine</em>. This means that there is a program that runs the actual program on top of it, keeping track of resources and memory usage. This has an added benefit of being platform-independent; the program can be run on any computer or device with the virtual machine installed.</p>
<h3>gcc</h3>
<p>One of the most used compilers of all time, gcc is the fundamental ground of development in the C programming language. Even many programming languages are themselves written in C, including Java, Python and others. GCC compiles programs into Operating System executable files.</p>
<h3>Clang</h3>
<p>Clang is like the modern version of gcc. Even though gcc is still developing, it has become less "bleeding-edge" and more of a stable ground. Clang is used most famously for the Objective C (iPhone and Mac) and C++ programming languages. Clang compiles programs into Operating System executable files.</p>
<h3>JavaC</h3>
<p>JavaC is the Java compiler. It compiles Java programs into something called <em>byte code</em>. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs these byte code files. There are many versions of JavaC, including Oracle Java SE to OpenJDK.</p>
<h2>Interpreters</h2>
<p>Interpreters runs files directly. In real time, they look at the instructions and decide what to do with them. This makes them more fragile because errors can creep up during runtime, but also more flexible, letting the programmer have less unnecessary code.</p>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>CPython is the default python bytecode interpreter. It compiles and runs python files. The interpreter automatically frees and uses memory as needed by the program, since it is a virtual machine.</p>
<h3>JVM</h3>
<p>Arguably the most used virtual machine ever, the Java Virtual Machine is not only used for Java code. Even python code can run on the JVM!</p>
