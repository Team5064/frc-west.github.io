<h1>Variables</h1>
<hr />
<p>Variables are names that represent values. In real life, you use names to refer to things. You do the same thing in programming. You can tell the computer that <code>X</code> will be 5.4, and from there on refer to X instead of 5.4. You can also change the value of X when needed.</p>
<p>Variables are dynamic types, meaning that you can declare them as any type that you want.</p>
<h2>Assigning</h2>
<p>To assign a variable, simply use <code>=</code> to declare the new value associated with the name. For example:</p>
<pre><code>x = 12.3221
</code></pre>
<p>From that point on, you can reference <code>x</code> as a value.</p>
<pre><code>print x # will print 12.3221
</code></pre>
<p>This is also useful for states.</p>
<pre><code>ready = false

def isReady():
    return ready

def readyUp():
    ready = true
</code></pre>
<p>Other parts of the code might call <code>readyUp</code>, and then you will know that it is ready.</p>
<h2>Referencing</h2>
<p>Variables have a <strong>scope</strong>. This means that if you create <code>x</code> inside of a method, it is only available in that method. Variables default to the <em>tightest</em> scope possible. For example:</p>
<pre><code># State can be accessed anywhere in the file
state = "working"

def printState():
    # User state can't be accessed anywhere outside of method
    userState = "Is " + state
    print userState
</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>userState</code> is only created inside of the method, you cannot see it from anywhere else.</p>
