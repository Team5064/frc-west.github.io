<h1>Number Algorithms</h1>
<hr />
<p>Algorithms are techniques. They are ways to accomplish a certain task. They are used in multiple locations to solve different goals. Writing algorithms is similar to teaching the computer how to do certain things.</p>
<p>Algorithms can vary in complexity, technique and form. Ultimately, the important part of algorithms is their use. If an algorithms doesn't work, it doesn't have value. This includes things called <em>edge cases</em>. Edge cases are theoretical situations in which the input to an algorithm is at the very edge of the realm of possibility. Algorithms must account for these.</p>
<p>Here's an example algorithm for the average of a group.</p>

<p>The key factor in an algorithm is that it doesn't depend on anything, and it will always return the same value as long as the same input is given.</p>
<p><strong>Feel free to play around with any of these algorithms. The best way to learn (especially if you're confused) is to try and tweak things.</strong></p>
<h2>Arithmetic</h2>
<p>Some algorithms use basic arithmetic operators to change values. This can be useful when you do the same thing multiple times in your code.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Here's a simple exponent algorithm.

<p>Here's a limiting algorithm that limits a value to a maximum.

<h3>Using Modular Arithmetic</h3>
<p>The prime factoring algorithm above uses some modular arithmetic. Here's a LCM algorithm.
