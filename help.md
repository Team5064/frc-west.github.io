FRC West has set up its curriculum hosted online. If you are experiencing difficulties with web pages not loading, it is likely a hosting problem that we have no control over.

## Navigating
You can find your courses at the top right-hand corner of every page. Every course is available there.

To look at content in courses, find the link on the right-hand side of the screen. All content in the course you're in will show up there.

## Website rendering
If this website has any glitches, bugs or just anything that doesn't look right, report them [here](https://github.com/joelg236/frc-west-curriculum/issues/new). You'll need an account on github to report issues.
