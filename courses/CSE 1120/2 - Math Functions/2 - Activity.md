Your job is to create some mathematical *algorithms* (remember the definition!). Each proceeding function will be slightly more difficult.

Using the python `math` library will result in a 0 for the question. :)

### To the Nth Power
Create a function that calculates X to the power of N.

**Test**

    X = 3; N = 3; RESULT = 9
    X = 4; N = 6; RESULT = 4096
    X = 1; N = 9; RESULT = 1
    X = 2.4; N = 2; RESULT = 5.76

### Rounding
Create a function that returns the value of X rounded to the nearest integer.

**Test**

    X = 12.1; RESULT = 12
    X = 1.9; RESULT = 2
    X = 3.5; RESULT = 4
    X = 34; RESULT = 34

### Factorial
Create a function that returns the factorial of X.

**Test**

    X = 3; RESULT = 6
    X = 10; RESULT = 3628800
    X = 1; RESULT = 1
    X = 7; RESULT = 5040

### Square Root
Create a function that returns the square root of X.

**Test**

    X = 5; RESULT = 2.2360679775
    X = 9; RESULT = 3
    X = 10; RESULT = 3.16227766017
    X = 81; RESULT = 9

You will not only be tested on the results of your program, but also on the quality of your method. Be sure to account for edge cases.
