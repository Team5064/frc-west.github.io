A computer is useless without any output. Imagine your laptop without a screen. There's almost nothing you could do with a computer without output. For this reason, output is just as important as processing. As good as your processing is, if the output is invalid it is useless. At the most basic level, computer are meant for providing usefulness to users.

So far, we've used `print` for output. This is fine as output when running programs from a command line. But since the 1990's, people have become accustom to GUI (Graphical User Interface). This is the combination of windows, controls, mouse and launchers on your computer. Of course, GUIs have bee extremely useful. Especially for allowing less technically skilled people to use computers. It makes computing easier.

But when and how do we use GUIs? Well, the question of when is still debated. Many users appreciate the efficiency of command-based computing. It still has many uses in the real world. But generally, when your program is going to be run by people without that skill, GUIs are better.

For now, we won't be making GUIs. The concepts of programming are better understood without the complexity of a GUI to manage. But you should be aware that they are a component of output that is very important for user interaction.
