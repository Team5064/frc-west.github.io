There is a concept that almost all higher-level programming languages use. This is known as the IPO, or "Input - Processing - Ouput" model. It is a simple concept, but encompasses the basic way that all programs are designed.

Input is received from an input device, that input is analysed, a reaction is calculated (or "processed") and finally the output is provided back. Typically, this is understood as a "user-computer-display" concept. But it involves a lot more than that. There is no need for a user or display in order for something to be considered IPO.

Although there are misconceptions about this model, it is a valuable way to describe computing.

## Internal Processing
You might be confused with the word "processing" at this point. Much of what we've done is very basic math, put together as something useful for a certain application. What we haven't explored, however, is the concept of processing.

Processing is not intelligent. It isn't even complex. Processing very rarely involves anything more complicated than a simple adding machine. You can subtract, multiply and divide using only addition. From there, almost anything is possible. The only real complication is the circuits for these operations. Thankfully, you don't need to worry about these, and neither do your users.

All of the seemingly intelligent instructions you provide python are in reality simplified into very easy calculating and instructions. A processor is typically only capable of jumping from position to position in machine code. With jumping (sometimes called branching), almost all control flow is defined.

So, when you're asked how a computer does so many things, you can answer "it doesn't". Most of the complicated stuff that we ask of computers is simplified before ever being given to the computer.

## As Functions
You can imagine the IPO model as a function. Functions have input (arguments), process and output (return). They are a fundamental piece of the IPO model. They can be an IPO or be part of one.
