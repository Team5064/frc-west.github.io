### 1. What will be printed after running this decision making code?

    if 13 < 12:
        print(1)
    elif 13 > 13:
        print(2)
    elif 13 > 12:
        if 81 % 9 > 2:
            print(3)
        else:
            print(4)

+ 1
+ 2
+ 3
+ 4

### 2. How do programs make decisions?

+ By using strategies to decide
+ By processing input
+ By calculating output
+ By finding out what is the best way

### 3. Why do programs need input?

+ To provide a way to interact with the user
+ To provide output
+ To make decisions
+ To provide a useful functionality to the user

### 4. What is an edge case?

+ A situation which requires special attention
+ A situation which happens infrequently
+ A situation which causes errors
+ An input which cannot be accounted for

### 5. An edge case is always possible

+ True
+ False

### 6. You should always account for edge cases in code

+ True
+ False

### 7. Accuracy is not defined by

+ Being exact with program behaviour
+ Using useful output
+ Using correct techniques to solve problems
+ Always using exact output

### 8. This algorithm is consistent

    def time():
        return 13 * 2

+ True
+ False

### 9. Consistency involves

+ Always having the same output
+ Always having accurate output
+ Always having the same result to an input
+ Always calculating the same way

### 10. In this program, what is the consistency problem?

    def p(x):
        print(x + raw_input())

+ Using raw_input
+ Adding x to raw_input
+ Printing
+ Using x
