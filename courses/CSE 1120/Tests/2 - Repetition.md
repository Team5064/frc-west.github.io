### 1. Why do we need loops in programs?

+ To simplify control flow
+ To add missing features
+ To count numbers
+ To create faster programs

### 2. How does a while loop allow factorials?

+ By comparing an index
+ By testing results
+ By repeating multiplication
+ By creating a total

### 3. How do we increment a variable by 1?

+ `x++`
+ `x += 1`
+ `1 + x`
+ `1++x`

### 4. How do we access a value in a dictionary?

+ A key
+ An index
+ A key and index
+ Using iteration

### 5. What is the difference between lists and tuples?

+ Accessing mechanisms
+ Adding functions
+ Storage
+ Mutability

### 6. `x` is a

    x = {
        (
            [1, 2, 3]
        ) : []
    }

+ Dictionary
+ List
+ Tuple
+ Integer

### 7. How would we iterate over the numbers in `x` in #6?

+ `for vals in x:`
+ `for vals in x.items():`
+ `for vals in x.items()[0]:`
+ `for vals in x[0]:`

### 8. Which definition fits bubble sort?

+ Comparing all (odd, even)-indexed pairs of adjacent elements in the list and, if a pair is in the wrong order (the first is larger than the second) the elements are switched
+ Repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order
+ Divides a large list into two smaller sub-lists: the low elements and the high elements, then recursively sort the sub-lists
+ Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted), then repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining

### 9. Why might be opt to use index instead of iterating through a list?

+ For performance reasons
+ To delete elements
+ To access other lists
+ To access other elements in the list

### 10. Elements in a list can be switched in one line of code

+ True
+ False
