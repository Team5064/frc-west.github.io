Something that happens very often to programmers (at any skill level) is loses in a program's *accuracy*. What do we mean by that though?

Accuracy is a combination of:

- Being concise with program behaviour (accounting for edge cases, using appropriate processing of input)
- Using appropriate structures and techniques to solve problems
- Providing useful output in algorithms

Breaking any of these rules makes your program inaccurate, unstable and questionable. This is known as having a "bug".

Bugs are not some kind of fatal flaw that makes your program unusable. They are behaviours of a program that are exhibited only at times, which damage the program's reputation as usable. If some kind of input is given, and an improper output is provided, the program needs to be fixed.

Do not, however, think that no programs have bugs. Don't even wonder if professional programmers make these kinds of mistakes. Everyone does. Bugs are a natural process of application development. There will be mistakes made, no matter how good and meticulous you are. This is okay.

Strategies for accuracy:

- At every level, analyse the things your program does. Make tests that ensure it acts the way it is intended to.
- When solving problems, ask yourself what the best techniques and structures are to solve the problem. Sometimes, there are flaws that aren't immediately obvious. (see [floats as money](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3730019/why-not-use-double-or-float-to-represent-currency) for an example)
- Test your algorithms with all kinds of output (edge cases and otherwise) to ensure output is appropriate

Even after employing these strategies, you might still make mistakes. This is okay, and asking questions can be a useful learning tool. [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is a great resource, but do not overuse it and learn nothing by yourself.
