In many applications, analog signals are sent through wires. These signals need a way to connect to other elements in an electronic system.

## Analog Signal
Analog signals are most often sent by using a voltage in the wire. The voltage is adjusted on the sending end, and the receiver interprets the change in voltage. This is the safest way to transfer signals because it will never put more than the maximum strain on the wire, and no signal is lost because of low voltage.

Unfortunately, analog signals can loose strength over distance.

### Data through analog
Analog signals are often interpreted into a digital signal, even if it is meant to be analog. For example, a potentiometer might be used to change the volume of music. The music player needs to convert the analog voltage signal into a digital number to adjust the playback volume. Analog signals are often converted to digital numbers for compatibility's sake.

## Standard Analog Connections
There are less standard analog connections than there are digital because an analog signal can vary a lot by use case. Serial and parallel ports are the most common analog connections. There is also many uses for 3 and 4 pin connectors, especially for fans. They allow one or two signals to be sent across the wire, with one positive and one negative wire. One signal is the fan speed, and the other can be the actual measured RPM.

## Noise
Due to the inherent way that analog connections work, it is difficult to provide any kind of exact signal. There is other electromagnetic noise everywhere, which can interfere with analog signals. It is the reason that radios can produce loud sounds that aren't from the radio station.

## Analog Devices
Many mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic systems use analog devices. Basically, anything that has a variable position is well suited for an analog connection.
