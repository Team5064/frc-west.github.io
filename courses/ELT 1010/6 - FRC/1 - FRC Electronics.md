There are FRC specific components that every team uses on their robot. The rules are relatively particular about how robots are wired, mostly for safety reasons.

Here's an overview of all FRC components:

## Some Basics
Here are some of the key things you'll need to know in FRC:

- Motors are controlled using speed controllers (named Victors, Talons or Jaguars)
- All power is distributed using the Power Distribution Board
- The most used FRC sensors are encoders, switches and potentiometers
