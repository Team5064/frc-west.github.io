Data is the most useful and versatile language in the world. It allows devices to communicate efficiently and without any error.

## Digital Signal
Unlike analog signals, digital signals have only two states - on and off. On is usually just a voltage over zero, and off is zero volts.

Digital signals are encoded in a format, which the receiver is equipped to understand or interpret. Formats vary, but oftentimes they are simply sets of rules of how to store data, and how to indicate the start and end of the data.

Like analog signals, digital signals can loose strength over length. Thankfully, small voltage drops aren't extremely bad for data transfer. It takes very large distances to completely loose digital signals.

### Analog through Digital
Numbers can be represented in digital. These numbers could be interpreted by a device and sent through an analog signal, reversing a digital signal into an analog one. Example, your music is stored as a digital file on your iPod and is converted in to a analog single that is audible to the human ear.

## Digital Standards
Digital standards are much different than analog ones. They concentrate on the actual data being transferred, and the connection used is rarely important. This is because of [abstraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_\(computer_science\)) of the components.

### Data Streams
Most likely, a receiver of digital information will be connected to that data through a data stream. This is kind of like a dam at a river. The water will build up at the dam until the water is somehow processed through. In the same way, a stream of data comes towards the receiver, forming a buffer of information that must be interpreted and processed. Unlike a dam however, the data cannot overflow.

### Networking
Things like local area connections and the internet use data connections to send and receive data from other computers. There are an enormous amount of different kinds of standards and ways of networking in computing.

## Digital Devices
Most devices are now digital. That means that they perform the majority of their important functions in a digital manner. For a lot of devices, this is through the processor or micro-controller.
