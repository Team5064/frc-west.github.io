### 1. Electricity flows because of

1. Differences in amperage
+ Differences in voltage
+ Differences in potential charge
+ Electrical repulsion

### 2. The difference between conductive and semi-conductive material is

1. Diameter
+ Resistance
+ Magnetic Potential
+ Heat dissipation

### 3. What does this symbol mean in electrical diagrams?

![Battery](http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/00021.png)

1. A battery
+ A resistor
+ A capacitor
+ A charge

### 4. A parallel circuit has

1. More than one battery
+ Two routes for electricity
+ Batteries put together
+ Multiple routes for electricity

### 5. Voltage is

1. The electrical potential difference
+ Flow of electric charge
+ Amount of electricity
+ Ability to store electrical charge

### 6. Capacitance is

1. The electrical potential difference
+ Flow of electric charge
+ Ability to store electrical charge
+ Amount of electricity

### 7. Resistors are made of

1. Non-conductive material
+ Insulated metals
+ Heat-treated metals
+ Semi-conductors

### 8. Direct Current is different from Alternating current because

1. The current goes farther in wires
+ The voltage is consistent
+ It is worse for electrical components
+ It can pulsate infrequently

### 9. The difference between a processor and micro-controller is

1. Its ability to perform any action given
+ Its ability to perform actions
+ Its ability to take input
+ Its ability to create output

### 10. The larger a wire's gauge is,

1. The smaller its diameter is
+ The larger its diameter is
+ The smaller its electrical potential is
+ The larger its electrical potential is
