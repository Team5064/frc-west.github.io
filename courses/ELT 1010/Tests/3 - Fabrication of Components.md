### 1. What is used to prevent oxidation in soldering?

1. Lead-free solder
+ Joints
+ Flux
+ Soldering iron

### 2. What is the main purpose of soldering in electronics?

1. To create electrical connections
+ To join metals together
+ To solidify connections
+ To create joints on PCB

### 3. Where is flux usually found?

1. In rolls insulated by plastic
+ Inside of solder iron
+ Outside of solder
+ Inside of solder

### 4. Which fluxes should you clean after soldering?

1. Rosin and Water soluble
+ Water soluble
+ RMA flux and Water soluble
+ Rosin and RMA flux

### 5. What is the most common problem with soldering?

1. Cold solder joint
+ Dry joint
+ Corrosion
+ Oxidisation

### 6. Transistors are small capacitors that store a charge

1. True
+  False

### 7. Modern communications are most commonly in what form?

1. Analog
+ UTF-8
+ Binary
+ Optical digital

### 8. Analog signals

1. Are sent by voltage
+ Are sent by amperage
+ Are sent using resistance
+ Are sent after being interpreted

### 9. Analog signals are converted to digital using

1. Changes in voltage
+ Capacitors
+ Thresholds
+ Voltage measuring

### 10. Digital signals loose data

1. After shorter lengths compared to analog
+ After longer lengths compared to analog
+ At the same lengths as analog
+ Very rarely
