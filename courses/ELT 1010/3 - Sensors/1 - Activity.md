To complete this activity, you will need:

- 1 5V Battery or Power Generator
- 1 Rotational Potentiometer rated for >= 5V ([ex](https://solarbotics.com/product/rt10k_t/))
- 1 Hall Effect Sensor rated for >= 5V ([ex](https://solarbotics.com/product/35055/))

Your job is to measure these two devices.

### Instructions to measure hall effect sensor

1. Connect pin 1 to +5V (actually anything from 5V to 20V would be fine)
2. Connect pin 2 to 0V
3. Connect a 50K resistor from +V to pin 3.
4. Using a multimeter, measure the voltage between pin 2 and 3 while you bring a magnet close to the device.
5. If you see a state change (i.e. a swing from almost 0 to almost the full supply voltage), the device is working.
