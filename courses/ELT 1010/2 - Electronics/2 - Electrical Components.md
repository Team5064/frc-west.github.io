Inside of a circuit, there are plenty of different kinds of components to use. This range of things includes simple components like switches to complex devices like microprocessors.

## Electrical Parameters
To use a device in a circuit, you need to understand how electricity is characterised and measured.

### Capacitance
Capacitance is the ability of a body to store electrical charge. The most common appearance of capacitance is in capacitors.

## Circuit Adjustment
There are components that adjust the electrical parameters of a circuit. Remember that these effect circuits differently depending on the type of circuit (series / parallel).

## Resistor
Resistors come in many different shapes, sizes and functions. To tell what the resistance of a resistor is, see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code#Resistor_color-coding). Resistor work using very specific semi-conductive materials that are manufactured for their purpose specifically. There are such things as variable resistors, such as potentiometers. These are less accurate and reliable than normal resistors.

## Capacitor
Capacitors work by storing energy thought the build up of a static electric field on plates inside of the capacitor. common applications of  capacitors are to store energy, block DC voltage while allowing AC voltage to pass through and to smooth outputs  of power supplies. They also come in many different shaps and sizes. 

## Diodes
A diode is an electrical component that only allows energy to pass through in one direction. Diodes can also be used to emit light and are called Light Emitting Diodes (LED).  

## Transistors
Transistors at their simplest form are switches that amplify electrical signals and power. Most transistors have 3 pins. When a voltage is applied to one, the power is allowed to flow through the other 2 pins.

## Sensors
In a lot of electronics, you need to find out things about the external world. This could be for a lot of reasons, like other sensor calibration. It could even be for computerised functions like an accelerometer in a cell phone for flipping the screen.

### Rotary Encoder
Encoders are useful for measuring speed and position of a rotating shaft. They are useful because they allow unlimited rotation, and are good at measuring data quickly. Typically, encoders are measured using 1 to 16 different sensors that measure on or off on a certain position of the shaft. The on or off signal comes from things like magnetic signals or visual signals. They can be found in both analog and digital packages.

### Accelerometer
Accelerometers measure [G-force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force). They use specialised technology that allows them to be used in many different kinds of applications. Smartphones use accelerometers to measure when to rotate the screen.

### Switch
The most simple electric sensor is the switch. Even though they are very simple, they are still useful.

### Optical Sensors
There are sensors that use visual queues as signals. Some of these sensors are simple cameras, and some are designed for certain applications. There are sensors that return whether there is a certain colour in front of them. Others can tell the distance from the object in front of them. There are a variety of optical sensors.

## Actuators
Along with sensors, it can be useful to perform actions in the physical world. Actuators do things to make physical objects move.

### Motor Controller
Before sending a current to a motor, it can be useful to specify what speed the motor should run at. Motor controllers allow a signal to control the speed. This can be an adjustment in voltage, or quick successive changes from on to off.

### Relays
Relays are electrically operated switches. They allow the electricity to move from left to right or right to left.

## Power Supplies
Power (voltage) can be supplied by a variety of different methods. Much of our locally supplied electricity is given in AC. This makes certain procedures necessary in components.

### AC-DC Conversion
[Rectifiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-DC_conversion) are used to convert electricity from alternating current to direct current. There are many different kinds of rectifiers. Some produce a constant voltage, and some simpler devices simply unify the signal, making it very inconstant. (half-wave or full wave)

### Current Protection
There are many risks to electronic devices from over-current. There isn't any de facto way to do current protection. [Fuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_\(electrical\)), [circuit breakers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker), [temperature sensors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_sensor) and [current limiters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_limiter) are all commonly used mechanisms.
