At the most basic level, electronics are composed of circuits. Circuits are flows of electrons that propagate through conductive materials, to produce some kind of desirable effect.

## Electricity
Electricity is the concept of flowing electrons. There are different forms of electricity, such as [static electricity](http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_1/1.html), [direct current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current) and [alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current). The form that is used most in electronics is direct current.

Electricity flows because of a different in electric potential. If one material is negatively charged, its electrons will be naturally attracted to positive materials. This different in "pressure" can be thought of like water. Rivers continue to flow because of the difference in pressure of one end and the other.

## Electron Flow
Electrons flow through conductive materials because of the difference in charge. Batteries are typically the cause of this difference. One end is negative, and one is positive. This makes the electrons in the negative side want to fill the difference in pressure, making a flow of electrons.

If, however, there is any break in the circuit, nothing flows. This is because the difference in charge is gone. The electrons are equally spread out and there is no reason to continue moving. It doesn't matter where the break is.

## Electric Circuits
To understand how electricity flows around in a circuit, we must understand the way batteries fit.

In electrical diagrams, batteries are symbolised using that symbol. A battery is just something that has two sides, one negative and one positive.

### Voltage
Voltage is the electrical potential difference. It is the difference in charge that creates a circuit. Zero volts would indicate a dead circuit. Voltage is measured in volts, which are equal to [joules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule) per [coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb). Multimeters are usually used to measure voltage in electronics.

### Current
Current is the flow of electric charge. It flows when there is voltage present across any conductor or load. The way to measure current is [ampheres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere), which is basically the "flow rate".

## Resistance

The circuit in the previous section is not a very practical one. In fact, it can be quite dangerous to build (directly connecting the poles of a voltage source together with a single piece of wire). The reason it is dangerous is because the magnitude of electric current may be very large in such a short circuit, and the release of energy very dramatic (usually in the form of heat). Usually, electric circuits are constructed in such a way as to make practical use of that released energy, in as safe a manner as possible.

One practical and popular use of electric current is for the operation of electric lighting. The simplest form of electric lamp is a tiny metal "filament" inside of a clear glass bulb, which glows white-hot ("incandesces") with heat energy when sufficient electric current passes through it. Like the battery, it has two conductive connection points, one for electrons to enter and the other for electrons to exit.

The metal filament that the electricity flows through is commonly known as *resistance*. Resistance is typically given by using *semi-conductors*. These materials allow electricity to pass through, but at a reduced rate. Another way to provide a safer circuit is by converting the electricity into another energy form. If these methods aren't used, extra electrical power is usually released as heat, which is dangerous for people and the devices they are a part of.

## Parallel and Series

A parallel circuit is where loads (eg: a light bulb) are all connected directly to the power source, instead of connecting together. (Left side) 89

In a series circuit the wires are connected together throughout the circuit. (Right side)
