To form circuits, send signals and transfer power, we need ways to connect our various devices.

## Wires
Wires come in many different sizes, shapes and standards.

### Gauges
Wire gauge is the measurement of its diameter. This determines the amount of current that the wire can safety carry, as well as its resistance. In Canada, the American Wire Gauge (AWG) standard is used.

The diameter of the wire is equal to:

As a general rule, the smaller the diameter is, the larger the gauge is. You can find the table [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge#Tables_of_AWG_wire_sizes).

### Colour Code
Canadian wiring is governed by the CEC (Canadian Electric Code). In general electronics,

- Red = Positive
- Black = Negative
- White or Green = Signal / Ground

## Connections
There are different ways to connect two circuits together to form a circuit between them.

### Standard Connections
There are standard in place that manufacturers follow to be compliant to.

#### Wall Outlets
There are standard outlets that are used most commonly for power sources, and more recently data. The standard wall outlet is [NEMA 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEMA_connector#NEMA_5) in Canada.

#### USB
The Universal Serial Bus is a standard for data and power transfer between devices. It replaces the serial port and parallel port.

#### Serial Ports
Although they are no longer used in mainstream computing, serial ports were very important in the history of electronics. Unlike parallel ports, they transfer one bit at a time. Serial ports are still sometimes used for VGA connections, although VGA uses a different standard than older computers.

#### Modular Connectors
Modular connectors are the standard used primarily by different kinds of data transfer, including telephones. There are different standards for sizes of modular connectors.
