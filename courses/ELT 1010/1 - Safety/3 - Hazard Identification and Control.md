Identifying hazards and controlling them can be your biggest asset. Knowing when to stop working and control a hazard is the difference between a safe and un-safe workplace.

## Possible hazards
There are many kinds of hazards. These are a few of the most common hazards related to electronic workplace safety.

* Failing to wear safe attire
* Distracting, teasing, abusing, or startling someone
* Operating equipment unexpectedly without warning people in the vicinity
* Operating equipment before checking out its condition
* Operating equipment before securing accessories
* Failing to shut off equipment that is unattended
* Operating equipment somewhere that is unsafe to do so
* Operating equipment while under the influence of drugs or alcohol
* Improper ventilation
* Spills (water or otherwise)

## Control
Often times, controlling hazards is very easy. You should, however, always control hazards.

Controlling a hazard is about removing the cause. If there is a spill, remove the thing that is spilling. After you have removed the cause, it is easy to simply clean up.

Remember to use precaution if cleaning up involves any kind of hazardous material. Be sure you properly know how to dispose of the material.
