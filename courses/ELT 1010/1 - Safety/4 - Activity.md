[Safety in Electronics](/resources/Safety-in-electronics.pptx)

Create a goanimate.com video story or use a software support that is equivalent.  
Utilize the example situations in the Safety in Electronics ppt presentation to create your animation. You can also create your own characters or story lines.

Some questions to consider when creating your animation: 

- Are you able to differentiate between an accident, an unsafe act, and an unsafe condition? 
- What can you do to help prevent accidents? 
- What special precautions should you take when working with electricity?

Save with your whole first and last name and upload your animation, video, movie maker, etc. to your D2L Dropbox folder of your ELT 1010 course.
