### 1. What is the difference between programming and computer science?

+ Programming is the application of computer science
+ Computer science is theoretical
+ Programming requires a computer to understand
+ Computer science is not useful in application

### 2. What makes a computer different from a human?

+ Its inability to process context
+ Its ability to execute instructions
+ Its consistency of execution
+ The speed of operations

### 3. How do computers execute instructions?

+ By transferring problems into basic math
+ By using sophisticated calculations
+ By executing binary files
+ By create virtual environments

### 4. What differentiates a programming language from other languages?

+ The consistency of syntax
+ It's ability to be executed by a computer
+ The way the language is constructed
+ It's inability to transfer information

### 5. What is the advantage of a program being cross-platform?

+ Not having to be re-compiled for each platform
+ Consistency of deployment (works the same way everywhere)
+ Easy to install
+ Being accessible to people with different systems

### 6. What is not part of syntax in a programming language?

+ Rules of how symbols are interpreted by the computer
+ The format of instructions and how they are interpreted
+ Rules about how data is saved
+ Ways to define data

### 7. What is the difference between source code and machine code?

+ Machine code is executable by computers
+ Machine code is not human-readable
+ Source code is executable by computers
+ Source code is not human-readable

### 8. What is low-level abstraction?

+ The simplification of code
+ Programming languages that create a simple control flow
+ Programs that provide functionality to other programs
+ GUI interfaces for users

### 9. What number is represented (in binary) here?

    0000101001010101

+ 2645
+ 1621
+ 2641
+ 1617

### 10. What would `230` be, represented in binary?

+ 11100111
+ 10011001
