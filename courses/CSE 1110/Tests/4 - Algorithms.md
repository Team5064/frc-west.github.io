### 1. Which function would return the amount of hours?

    minutes = 230
    
    def foo1():
        return minutes / 60
    def foo2():
        return minutes - (minutes % 60)
    def foo3():
        return int(minutes / 60)
    def foo4():
        return int(minutes % 60)

1. foo1
+ foo2
+ foo3
+ foo4

### 2. What is the correct definition of an algorithm?

1. A function returning an output
+ A virtual method that determines an output based on input
+ An input-output machine
+ A processing element that produces output

### 3. What algorithm would be able to use modular arithmetic?

1. Factoring
+ Division
+ Exponent
+ Square root

### 4. An algorithm will always return the same result

1. True
+ False

### 5. Algorithms can be used to do different calculations in different programs

1. True
+ False

### 6. The result printed is

    print "Hello" + 'World' + '!'
    
1. Hello World !
+ Hello World!
+ "Hello"+'World'+'!'
+ HelloWorld!

### 7. This algorithm will return what when given "Hello" as input?

    def foo(x):
        return x.find('e')

1. Hllo
+ Hello
+ 2
+ 1

### 8. Using `+` between two strings will produce

1. A hexadecimal representation of the hashes added together
+ A new string containing both strings
+ The first string with the second string added
+ An error in python

### 9. What does the `[x:x]` operator do to strings?

1. Creates a substring between the indexes
+ Splits the string into parts
+ Creates a new string that has both variables attached
+ Accesses the characters at the given indexes

### 10. What would `"Example String"[2:4]` be equal to?

1. 'am'
+ am
+ xa
+ 'xa'
