For this activity, you will need:

- Python 2.7 installed on your computer
- Text Editor
- Command Prompt

Create a text file in your documents folder with the name `script.py`. Then, type `cd Documents` (In XP this might be "My Documents" - check the folder name) in your command prompt. You should then be in your documents.

Now type `python script.py`. This should execute the file you just made. (Nothing will happen because there are no instructions) As a test, add `print("Hello World")` in the text file and run it again.

Put this script into `script.py`, and replace the `# REPLACE` sections with code that fits the description.

    var1 = 13.44
    var2 = 104
    var3 = 12.1
    var4 = 1
    
    
    # REPLACE - Set x1 to var1 plus var2
    print(str(var1) + " + " + str(var2) + " = " + str(x1))


    # REPLACE - Set x2 to var3 minus var2
    print(str(var3) + " - " + str(var2) + " = " + str(x2))


    # REPLACE - Set x3 to var4 multiplied by var1
    print(str(var4) + " * " + str(var1) + " = " + str(x3))


    # REPLACE - Set x4 to var3 divided by var1
    print(str(var3) + " / " + str(var1) + " = " + str(x4))
