Algorithms are techniques. They are ways to accomplish a certain task. They are used in multiple locations to solve different goals. Writing algorithms is similar to teaching the computer how to do certain things.

Algorithms can vary in complexity, technique and form. Ultimately, the important part of algorithms is their use. If an algorithms doesn't work, it doesn't have value. This includes things called *edge cases*. Edge cases are theoretical situations in which the input to an algorithm is at the very edge of the realm of possibility. Algorithms must account for these.

Here's an example algorithm for the average of a group.

The key factor in an algorithm is that it doesn't depend on anything, and it will always return the same value as long as the same input is given.

**Feel free to play around with any of these algorithms. The best way to learn (especially if you're confused) is to try and tweak things.**

## Arithmetic
Some algorithms use basic arithmetic operators to change values. This can be useful when you do the same thing multiple times in your code.

### Examples
Here's a simple exponent algorithm.

Here's a limiting algorithm that limits a value to a maximum.

### Using Modular Arithmetic
The prime factoring algorithm above uses some modular arithmetic. Here's a LCM algorithm.

# Activity
Let's try doing this yourself. Create an algorithm that uses the exponent algorithm above but returns half the value. Answer available [here](http://frc-west.codepad.org/xCG4FJIP).
