Algorithms transfer an input to an output. It's not some kind of magical concept.

This is still considered an algorithm:

    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

You can see what it's doing. Nothing fancy or complex is really going on. You can then do this with the function:

    x = multiply(12, 10)

`x` is now 120.

In the multiplication algorithm, `x` and `y` are the input, and the product is the output.

The main fact about algorithms is that they **do not rely on other elements of the program**. They will always return the same output when given the same input.
