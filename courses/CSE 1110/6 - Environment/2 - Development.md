As a programmer, there are a variety of tools available.

## IDE
Integrated Development Environments (IDE) are programs used to create programs. They offer more than just text input. Some have re-factoring tools, version control support and many have debugging tools.

Popular IDEs
* Python - NetBeans, PyDev, PTVS, Sublime Text
* Java - NetBeans, IntelliJ, Eclipse
* C - Emacs, Notepad++, NetBeans

## Development Tools
There are a lot of possible tools to help with developing code. Some help testing, debugging, profiling or even management. Code can become an immense task without the right tools.

### Debugging Tools
Sometimes a simple stack trace or error message doesn't help find a problem. For this reason, there are debugging tools made to examine exactly how your program behaves and why something is happening.

Popular debuggers
* Python - winpdb
* Java - jdb, jswat
* C - ddd

### Profiler
If you find that a program is working slowly or takes too much memory / CPU, a profiler can find what is taking up resources. Remember, however, that "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil"

### Version Control
When writing large projects, it can be helpful to keep track of changes made to the program, so that you can reverse those changes when needed. Version control lets you keep track of changes and versions. There are different kinds of version control (mainly *distributed version control* and *central version control*).

Popular version control
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [SVN](http://subversion.apache.org/)
* [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)
