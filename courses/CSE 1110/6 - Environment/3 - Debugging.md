Sometimes a simple stack trace or error message doesn't help find a problem. For this reason, there are debugging tools made to examine exactly how your program behaves and why something is happening.

Popular debuggers

* Python - winpdb
* Java - jdb, jswat
* C - ddd

Debugging is an intricate process in programming. In order to become a good programmer, you need to know exactly what is going wrong - quickly.
