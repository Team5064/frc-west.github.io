One of the most important development in the past 100 years is the processor. This device is capable of executing simple instructions, and storing the results of those functions. This is all done electronically without any moving parts.

The reason we've looked at relays and logic gates is that they are the building blocks for a processor. With some circuitry to manage signals, addressing and other various jobs, we can create a processor. But why do we care?

Processors are the single most important part of a feedback loop control system. And almost all modern control systems use feedback loops. We don't want to manually do everything anymore. It would be a waste of time to hire someone to constant manage the heating system in a building. Having a circuit with sensors perform this function for you makes one less thing to do.

Processors make everything easier, more efficient and less redundant. You're using processors all of the time, even in unlikely places. How does a microwave know when to stop heating food? How does a fan stay at a constant speed? How does you TV manage all of the different inputs? The answer is processors.

Don't be confused, however. Processors are very far away from "intelligent". At their core, they are simple adding machines with latches for memory. The complex circuitry enables some useful functions. Combinations of gates are used to determine what an instruction means, and then that instruction is executed. When we refer to execution, we only mean to say that the circuit is complete. Adding is not some kind of "loading and complete action" formula - it is a simple combination of transistors that just happen to add two numbers together. They are only limited in speed by physical components, heat and clock speed.

Clock speed is the frequency of instructions that are executed. A faster clock speed refers to the processor's actual "clock" that turns on and off very quickly. This on an off signal tells the processor to execute the next instruction.

So how does a processor help with control systems? Mostly, it has to do with instructions. If we can used conditions and sophisticated math like PID, we can use the output to control a system better. You are much better off using PID than manually controlling a device.
