Control systems take advantage of sensors. They use the input of the sensors to determine what output to use. There are many different kinds of sensors. Generally, if you can receive some kind of useful information from a device, it is considered a sensor.

Sensors are divided into 4 different categories

- On / Off
- Digital
- Analog
- Frequency

### On / Off Sensors
Sensors who have two possible states are on/off sensors. A distinction is needed, however, from digital and frequency sensors. This distinction is that on/off sensors need a trigger of some kind to change states. They do not usually switch states at high freqencies.

Usually, on/off sensors are things like switches. You can use switches as "limit switches", meaning that a mechanical component will hit a switch at its physical limit, signalling to turn off the mechanical component. This is useful to prevent damage when you can't always keep an eye on a device.

### Digital Sensors
Digital sensors have circuitry on them that interprets something in the world, and sends that information as a digital signal. These are less common than any other sensor, but are still seen occasionally in industry and commercial products. Their advantage is that there is no need to use an analog-to-digital converter.

Commonly, accelerometers, encoders and optical sensors are digital sensors. Of course, not all of them are digital, but they are more commonly found in digital formats.

### Analog Sensors
The most common sensors with the longest history are analog sensors. These are sensors which measure a physical property and represent that with a variable voltage. This technology goes back to record players, who read variable bumps on a vinyl record.

Analog sensors need analog-to-digital converters to interpret their signals on a computer. Since computers cannot read anything but binary representations, this is neccesary.

Some examples of analog sensors are potentiometers, gyroscopes and microphones.

### Frequency Sensors
Arguably on / off sensors, frequency sensors are used to measure changes of on/off signals. They are mostly defined by their actual application, instead of the capability. Frequency sensors require a counter to keep track of on/off signals. With a computer to manage this counter, useful signals can be found.

Frequency sensors are typically used for measuring velocity or distance. Velocity would be the freqency of the signal, and distance would be the ammount of signal changes. Almost always, frequency sensors measure a repetitive motion like a wheel spinning.

Common frequency sensors are encoders, optical sensors, hall effect sensors and small switches.
