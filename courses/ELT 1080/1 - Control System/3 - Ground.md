You've seen ground before. In Canada, every power outlet has a ground. It's the bottom hole.

You might have wondered before what that hole is for. Isn't electricity just a circle? Where does the ground go?

Ground is actually a strange concept. It originates from the time of telegraphs. But first, let's distinguish between two definitions.

### Ground as protection
One of the sources of confusion about ground is the word's two usages. The most popular way to describe ground is the protection of circuits. This can be for high voltage components, or electrostatic-sensitive devices. Electricity finds the fastest route to the ground, so having a conductive material straight to the ground helps.

But this definition leaves many important usages behind.

### Ground as a return path
This definition is much more broad. It actually includes the first one. But it's important to remember that ground is used in many other applications.

In situations where running wires for very long distances is necessary, such as telegraphs, using ground is literal. You can actually use the earth as a conductive material to complete a circuit. Of course, this yields some disadvantages. You can't send both sides of the circuit through ground, but you can certainly send one.

You might ask how electricity knows where to go once it is in the ground. It doesn't. We just think of ground as a conductor for convenience. What actually happens is just other electrons being attracted to the other side. The earth is full of them, literally.

But ground doesn't neccesarily mean "ground" as in earth. Things like vehicles, cell phones and many others have grounds. These are just common recipricals for electricity.

### Example
You could set up your relay to talk to your friend to use ground. It would look like this:

Notice that you now only need one wire that goes from your friend's house to yours now. Although this doesn't seem like a big deal in your situation, it certainly is for large scale communications.
