### 1. What is the difference between a digital and analog sensor?

- What they measure
- How they measure
- How they output
- Their signal strength

### 2. What is the advantage of a digital sensor?

- No ADC
- Fast interpreting
- Signal clarity
- Frequency readings

### 3. What is not a limiting factor of processors?

- Physical components
- Heat
- Clock speed
- Power

### 4. What does a clock in a processor do?

- Turns on and off
- Controls a processor
- Manages heat of a processor
- Keeps track of time

### 5. What are speed controllers used for?

- Processor clocks
- Motor speed
- Signal decouplers
- Power adjustment

### 6. What makes relays different from speed controllers?

- Ability to turn on and off
- Ability to adjust voltage
- Mechanical components
- Faster adjustment

### 7. What is an internal feedback loop?

- Loop using output as an input
- Loop using only processor
- Loop using no input
- Loop without control

### 8. What does a breakout board do?

- Seperates large input into smaller single outputs
- Seperates analog from digital signals
- Combines multiple inputs into one
- Converts digital to analog signals

### 9. What is a device that uses DAC?

- Keyboard
- Speakers
- Scroll wheel
- Potentiometer

### 10. What is the main advantage of ADCs?

- Increases speed
- More accurate
- Easier to read
- Takes load off processor
