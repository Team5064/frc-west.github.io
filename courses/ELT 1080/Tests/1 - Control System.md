### 1. What function does a logic gate perform?

- A comparison
- An addition
- An opperation
- A reversal

### 2. With inputs of `1` and `1`, what does an XOR gate output?

- 1
- 0
- Illegal operation

### 3. How does a flip-flop preserve its state?

- Loop of logic gates
- Magnetic storage
- Solid state storage
- Separate power sources

### 4. What is the difference between hardware and software looping?

- Technique used to loop
- Speed of looping
- Running instructions in loop
- Ability to reverse loop

### 5. What is the main advantage of ground as a return path?

- Simple circuits
- Less wires
- Faster travel time
- Protection from static

### 6. Why does earth grounding not always work?

- Resistance
- Noise
- Differences in voltage
- Changes of voltage

### 7. What is not considered a form of control?

- User input
- Hardware
- Software
- Physical interaction

### 8. What does a carry signal mean in binary addition?

- Addition of the numbers resulted in a number higher than the current position
- Addition of the numbers resulted in a 2
- Addition of the numbers resulted in a 0
- Addition resulted in too high of a number

### 9. What is the advantage of PID over bang-bang control?

- Overshoot compensation
- Accurate control
- Fast arrival time
- Robustness

### 10. When would bang-bang control be appropriate?

- Driving a car
- A free-spinning wheel
- Moving an arm
- Adjusting motor speed
