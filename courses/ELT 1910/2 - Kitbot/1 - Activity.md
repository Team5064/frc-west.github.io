You will be creating a kitbot!

The guide is found [here](http://www.simbotics.org/resources/kitbot).

After finishing your kitbot build, you will need to write a short (1 page) summary of the components and fabrication of FRC robots. Use your experience with the kitbot as an example of an FRC robot.
