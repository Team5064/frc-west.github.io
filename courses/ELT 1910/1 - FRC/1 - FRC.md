# Build Season
During the build season (the six weeks following the kickoff) teams begin to design a robot that is able to play the game, essentially from scratch. Team members typically spend the time designing strategies to play the game, drawing up ideas for robot parts, working with size and weight constraints, and finally, building and assembling their robot. Other challenges include gaining driver experience, building the electronics for the robot, and software development. After the build season has ended (usually the 3rd full week of February), teams must stop work on their robot before transporting it to the location of their first competition. This date is typically referred to as "ship date," as past competitions required the shipment of the robot to the first competition on this date. However, competitions are increasingly "bag and tag," where robots are sealed in a bag prior to competitions, and transported at the team's expense. Although the term "bag and tag date" has been proposed, "ship date" is still far more commonly used. Competitions for FIRST consist of dozens of regional competitions and one championship event.

# Competition
Most FIRST regional events take place between Thursday and Saturday in a week in March. Thursday is typically a practice day where matches take place but do not count towards final standings. All day Friday and on Saturday morning, teams participate in qualifying matches. On Saturday afternoon, after the qualification matches have ended, the top eight ranked teams will pick partners from any team ranked below them, and the resulting alliances will compete to be regional winner. The top teams pick their partners starting with the top-ranked team, proceeding to the 8th ranked team, then back from the 8th team to the 1st team again. The alliances picked this way then proceed into elimination rounds, set up into quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. Each quarterfinal, semifinal, and final is determined by a best-of-3 matchup between the two alliances.

### Pit Areas
These are the areas where teams work on their robots. These numbered spaces help organize team placement and help team members, judges and visitors find teams easily. These areas are set up to be as equal as possible. Each team's Pit will have a table and power outlet.

### Machine Shop
Some events have a machine shop to help teams with repair and fabrication either sponsored by NASA or local organizations. While the machine shops vary, FIRST strives to have welding and a variety of high-powered tools available at the shop. 

The staff and volunteers in the Pit Admin station will be able to tell you how to make use of the machine shop.

### Matches
Only the 2 drivers and 1 coach participate in matches. The rest of team members can watch from the spectator seats. Matches are typically 2:15 minutes, so schedules are very quick. You will need to do pit stops quickly and efficiently.

# Gracious Professionalism
Dr. Woodie Flowers, FIRST National Advisor and co-founder of FRC, elaborates on the significance of Gracious Professionalism in FIRST:

> “FIRST celebrates high-quality, well-informed work done in a manner that leaves everyone feeling valued. Gracious Professionalism seems to be a good descriptor for a big part of the ethos of FIRST. It is one of the things that makes FIRST different and wonderful.

> Gracious attitudes and behaviors are win-win. Gracious folks respect others and let that respect show in their actions. Professionals possess special knowledge and are trusted by society to use that knowledge responsibly. Thus, gracious professionals make a valued contribution in a manner pleasing to others and to themselves.

> In FIRST, Gracious Professionalism means that we learn and compete like crazy, but treat one another with respect and kindness in the process. We try to avoid leaving anyone feeling like they have lost. No chest-thumping barbarian tough talk, but no sticky sweet platitudes either. Knowledge, pride and empathy comfortably blended."

# Coopertition
Coopetition is a neologism coined to describe cooperative competition. FIRST Robotics values coopertition as a fundamental part of the program.

# Awards
There are many awards given to teams at the end of the event. Most of them are evaluated at the event, but some require some preparation.

## Chairman's award
The Chairman's Award is the most prestigious award a team can win at a regional or at the championship, more so than even winning the competition itself. Demonstrating the prestige of the award, a team that wins a Regional Chairman's Award receives a reserved spot at the championship event so that they may compete for the Championship Chairman's award, regardless of their on-field performance. The Chairman's award was created to recognise teams that demonstrate the greatest commitment to spreading passion about science and technology into their communities and schools. Submission involves writing an essay of no more than 10,000 characters documenting the team's efforts at spreading the message of FIRST, a five-minute presentation to a panel of judges — followed by a five-minute Q&A session for the judges — and a three-minute video.

## Woodie Flowers Award
The Woodie Flowers Award is awarded to a mentor within a team that the team believes has made a large contribution to them and deserves to be recognised. Criteria is based on how well the chosen mentor inspires the students towards better communication and engineering. Any regional WFA winner is eligible to be considered for the Championship WFA, though past regional WFA winners may not again win a regional WFA, to allow other mentors the chance to be recognised. The WFA trophy itself is a head-sized Möbius strip with bearings inside it.

## Dean's List Award
The Dean's List Award is given to individual student team members. Much like the Woodie Flowers Award for mentors, the Dean's List Award is to recognise students for their technical knowledge, leadership skills, and their ability to inspire their team toward the mission of FIRST. Teams are allowed to recognise 2 students on their team as Dean's List Semi-Finalist, as semi-finalist they eligible to win the Dean's List Finalist Award at a regional. 2 Dean's List Finalist Awards are given out at every regional. At the annual FIRST Championship 10 finalists are then awarded the Dean's List Award during a special award ceremony.
