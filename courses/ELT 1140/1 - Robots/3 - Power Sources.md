There are many ways different ways to power machines. There are different benefits and consequences of each.

## Electrochemical
Electrochemical energy is provided by conversion of chemicals. It is usually used in [fuel cells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cells) and [photoelectrochemical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectrochemical).

## Pneumatic
Pneumatic energy is provided by pressurised gas. It is usually used to power cylinders that push and pull devices.

## Solar (traditional and fuel cell)
Solar energy converts the light into usable electricity. Traditionally, this involves collecting light from the sun. There is also a subsection of solar energy that artificially produces a fuel cell by photosynthesis. This is known as a [solar fuel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_fuel)

## Wind
Wind energy converts the actual wind into usable electricity. Winds are everywhere on the earth, so wind power has a lot of potential. Typically, wind power is converted using [wind turbines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine).

## Hydraulic
Hydraulic power (or hydropower) converts the energy of water flow to usable electricity. Typically, this is done using dams or watermills.

## Biological
Biological energy, typically [biomass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass) converts living or dead biological material into energy. It is most commonly used in developing countries because it is easy to produce and has little negative effects.

## Electromagnetic
Electromagnetic power is one of the fundamental forces in nature. It is described by electromagnet fields. When electricity travels through matter, it forms a magnetic pull around it that effects the rest of the world.
