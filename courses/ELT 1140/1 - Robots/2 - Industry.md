Robots are used mainly in five industries:

- Assembly lines
- Medical surgeries
- Military (bomb-squads, drones)
- Domestic usages (vacuums, cars, etc.)
- Space exploration

## Assembly lines
Starting with [unimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimate), assembly lines have benefited a lot from robots. They are cheap, efficient and long-lasting replacements for human workers.

Arms are the most used, because they easily replace humans. They provide speed, accuracy and ease of use for most applications. Vision guidance is also becoming a huge component of assembly lines. With visual markers, robots can accurately perform jobs without other processes being precise.

According to the International Federation of Robotics, there were at least 1 million operational industrial robots by the end of 2011.

## Medical surgeries
By using precise computers and robots, surgeons can perform operations much safer and accurately. Things like brain surgery, and bypasses benefit a lot from medical robots.

Camera robots are also used commonly to see inside of the body without opening too much skin and bone. This is known as [Laparoscopic surgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery).

## Military
The military has made recent advancements in robotics. They use robots for many different uses.

#### Bomb Disposal
Robots are good for disposal of bombs or otherwise dangerous goods. It eliminates the need for a human to be put in danger. Robots are also very accurate and unlike a human can't get nervous.

#### Drones
Unmanned vehicles are used in many sections of the military and government. Although their use is debated, they are clearly important technological advances. The complexity required to move without any human interactions is impressive.

## Space Exploration
Although there haven't been many actual uses of robots in space, they have been important in the exploration of places too far for humans.

The [mars rovers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_rover) are the most famous robots in space. They use sophisticated technology to explore the surface of mars.

Many other satellites and spaceships could also be considered robots. The [voyager program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program) is a very important mission that sent two unmanned probes into outer space.
