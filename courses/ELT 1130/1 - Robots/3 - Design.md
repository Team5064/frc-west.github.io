As talked about in [principles](../1 - Principles), design is a crucial element of robotics. It is the defining factor of what a robot will look like and act in the real world. Design is a somewhat abstract topic, however, considering that it requires a lot of unique thinking without any kind of rules or guidelines. Most of design will be mental - you slowly become more in tune with what works and what doesn't through experience.

# The design process
There are many ways to design things. We'll describe one of the most popular and effective ones.

### Setting goals
The first thing to do before setting on a design is to examine and set goals. You need to know what a robot needs to do before you can actually design something. This stage is important, because it sets the bar of every other step.

To set goals, you need to evaluate what you're trying to do. Let's say you're designing a robot to throw a basketball. You might set these goals:

- Can drive
- Can pick up basketball
- Can shoot basketball

These goals are simple and attainable. Remember, trying to do too much is a recipe for failure. It is rarely beneficial to do *too much*.

### Strategy
Although closely related to setting goals, strategy is slightly different. It is about finding ways to accomplish the goals. In the example situation, your strategy would most likely look like this:

- Uses 6 wheel drivetrain
- Uses an arm to pick up balls
- Uses a wheel to shoot balls

You'll notice that the strategy gives some direct answers to the question "how?" in your goals.

There can also be an element of game strategy. This comes into play when the goal of a robot is to play some kind of game. If this is the case, your strategy will involve things like gameplay and you move in the game. This strategy is important, and is mostly involved with the "setting goals" process.

### Design
After you know exactly how you will accomplish your goals, you need to design those models. Design, at this point, continues throughout the rest of the process. You will constantly be coming back to it, iterating on what exactly the robot will be like.

Design can be done in a multitude of ways, but typically sketches, models and CAD (Computer Aided Design) are the most effective. You can use sketches to give general outlines, models to give specific details and CAD to assemble and play with all of your pieces. The combination of the three helps create a process that slowly defines what the robot will be, continuously improving design.

### Prototyping
After you have a general idea of what your robot will do, how it will do it and with what, you should prototype that design. From there, you can examine the real-life performance of your designs, and usually find improvements. You should not limit yourself to prototyping only one design. Prototyping multiple designs is easy and gives better insight into the design.

Prototyping doesn't mean creating an entire robot. Remember, the purpose is to find out if components work well. Prototype your major designs. Dont't prototype things you know work (ie. drivetrain).

Prototypes can be made out of anything. Anything from wood to 3D printed parts can all fulfil the requirements of a prototype. The key is to make things fast.

### Finalising
After you are happy with your design and prototypes, there is a point where you need to finalise that design. Before finalising, you should evaluate a few things:

- Are the goals accomplished by the design?
- Does the prototype work as well as needed?
- Can the final machine be changed if need-be?
- Does the design follow the principles of design?

These are important questions to ask before starting on the final building process. They allow you to take a step back and see if you're headed in the right direction.
