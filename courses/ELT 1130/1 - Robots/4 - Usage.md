Robots are important in the world. As time goes by, they are doing more and more jobs. 

# History
The history of robotics does not go back very far in time. Most useful robots have been developed in the past 50 years.

### Beginnings
Leonardo da Vinci is one of the first people to design a machine that performs actions without human interaction. His [mechanical knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%27s_robot) is one of the first documented automations of human motion.

Disregarding some early attempts at primitive robots, the true beginning of the recent ideas of what a robot is is science fiction. In [I, Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot),  Isaac Asimov created a vision of what robots are before the technology was even possible. From there, many other science fiction media has been made with robots as an element. Many are listed [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_robots_and_androids), notably the Jetsons, Doctor Who and Robby the Robot.

### Modern robots
The development of modern robots started around 1940. [Elektro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektro) was shown at the world fair in 1939, and was able to do many extraordinary things. He could respond to human voice commands, as well as talking in fluent sentences. Obviously this was very primitive, but was still amazing for the time. It pushed computer technology, as well as voice recognition.

The first appearance of a useful robot (not for spectacle) was [unimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimate). It was used by the GM assembly line in the 1950s. From this point on, a major use for robotics has been assembly lines in industry. It's basic design (highly manoeuvrable hand) is still very commonly used.

# Industry
Robots are now being used in many different industries. The majority of usage is in:

- Assembly lines
- Medical surgeries
- Military (bomb-squads, drones)
- Domestic usages (vacuums, cars, etc.)
- Space exploration

Robots are well suited for uses where humans cannot be as meticulous and consistent. They can also be used to keep people safe from harm, like bomb diffusing.
