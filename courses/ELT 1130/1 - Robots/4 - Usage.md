Robots are important in the world. As time goes by, they are doing more and more jobs. 

# History
The history of robotics does not go back very far in time. Most useful robots have been developed in the past 50 years.

### Beginnings
Leonardo da Vinci is one of the first people to design a machine that performs actions without human interaction. His [mechanical knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%27s_robot) is one of the first documented automations of human motion.

Disregarding some early attempts at primitive robots, the true beginning of the recent ideas of what a robot is is science fiction. In [I, Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot),  Isaac Asimov created a vision of what robots are before the technology was even possible.

### Modern robots
The development of modern robots started around 1940. [Elektro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektro) was shown at the world fair, and was able to do many extraordinary things. The first appearance of a useful robot (not for spectacle) was [unimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimate). It was used by the GM assembly line in the 1950s. From this point on, a major use for robotics has been assembly lines in industry.

# Industry
Robots are now being used in many different industries. The majority of usage is in:

- Assembly lines
- Medical surgeries
- Military (bomb-squads, drones)
- Domestic usages (vacuums, cars, etc.)
- Space exploration

Robots are well suited for uses where humans cannot be as meticulous and consistent. They can also be used to keep people safe from harm, like bomb diffusing.
