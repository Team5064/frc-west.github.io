Pneumatic power is pressurised air. It is used for fast-acting devices like cylinders.

Pneumatic power is provided by pressurised tanks and/or air compressors. These two provide air at high pressures.

Air pressure powers

- Cylinders
- Gear shifters

Hydraulic power is pressurised liquids. It is used for high-power uses like lifting large weight.

Hydraulic power is provided by other power sources like pumps. It is used to provide a high-power alternative to pneumatics that can handle much higher weights and pressures.

Hydraulics powers

- Cylinders
- Platforms
