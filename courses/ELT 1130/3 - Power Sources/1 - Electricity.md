The most common source of power for robots is electricity. This is because electricity is powerful enough, and makes elaborate control very easy. With computation, behaviour is enhanced to a high level.

Electricity is provided through batteries. This is because they are portable and easy to replace.

Electricity powers

- Processor
- Signals
- Motors
- Solenoids (switches)
- Sensors

Even though something like gas power would be more powerful, electricity is used because of its flexibility and consistency.
