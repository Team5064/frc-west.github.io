In this activity, you will build a VEX robot that accomplishes the following tasks:

- Pick up, lift and drop ping-pong ball
- Drive (straight and turn)

Use a small box or basket as a goal, and try to pick up and drop balls in the box.

Make a 1/2 page summary of your robot, its design and its components.
