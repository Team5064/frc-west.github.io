A drivetrain is the basic system that drives. It encompasses the motors, the gearboxes, the frame, the axles and the wheels.

### Motors
Motors are typically attached to some kind of gearbox. This is done to adjust torque and speed. It also makes the output shaft (the output of a gearbox) more consistent instead of having two or more motors going at slightly different speeds.

### Gearboxes
Gearboxes are small boxes that carry gears inside that adjust the output speed and torque. Gearboxes can have one or more motors as input, but almost always only have one output (the output shaft).

### Frame
Frames are the body of a robot. They hold everything together. There are many different ways to build a frame, but most are rectangular or square.

### Wheels and Axles
Wheels move the robot around. They are the lowest point on a robot, because they touch the ground. Axles run through wheels, allowing them to rotate together. Usually, power is applied to the axle which rotates the wheel.
